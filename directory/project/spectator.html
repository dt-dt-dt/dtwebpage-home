            <h2>Concept</h2>
                <p>An attempted “fly on the wall” mockumentary/short film. It’s “attempted,” because the cameraman is an actual interactable character in the world.</p>
                <p>It starts with quick glances. Little mistakes. Bumping into the camera accidentally.</p>            
                <p>Then people realize there’s a cameraman. They ask for favours. “Can you pass that?” “Hey, look over there.”</p>
                <p>Then the cameraman starts to get in the way. People are angry with him. Everyone is unhappy with him. This sucks.</p>
            <h3>Commentary</h3>
                <p>We live in surveillance. We expect it. Cameras are everywhere. Cameras are invisible. Broadcasting possible at any moment. A record of it exists everywhere. But you don't see it. Aren't they everywhere? How do you know you're being watched?</p>
                <p>The camera in a film is invisible. It represents the audience's eyes-- what they can see, what they're allowed to see. It is information. Information is everywhere, but only useful when contextualized. When the camera is suddenly made apparent (!visible), the structure underneath is revealed. The illusion of the story is destroyed.</p>
                <p>There is no longer a movie. These aren't characters. These are people, with their own intricate lives. The camera is technology. It isn't the audience. Systems break down, nobody's in control. Or some shit.</p>
                <p>The story should vaguely follow people unsatisfied with surveillance. Make it absurd to abstract the camera thing.</p>

            <h2>Plot</h2>
                <p class="highlight-hiatus">This is adapted from another story idea (In Burbia), which is adapted from this dream I had. I'm going to need help adapting this heavily.</p>
                <p>[!note] It actually isn’t super important. The concept remains the same.</p>
                <p>There’s a club/society. The new president of the club is receiving complaints of a “homeless” thug. (THE NO-TECH SOCIETY)</p>
                <p>The president is new. They go check it out naively. They do “everything” (not much) to berate the “homeless” thug. He’s just some dude.</p>
                <p>The club huddle up. The other residents tell the president to be sterner. Yell, scream, etc. The president’s hesitant. The residents insist.</p>
                <p>They charge towards the door and throw cans and bottles, and yell and scream. The man leaves.</p>
                <p>The residents cheer. Call for celebration. The president is increasingly uneasy.</p>
                <p>Residents circle. They have a pot of sugar and pass it around, putting it on their faces.</p>
                <p>The president is like, “wtf??”</p>
                <p>There’s a knock. It’s the “homeless” man. He’s pissed.</p>
                <p>The residents clamour. They’re petrified. They push the president to attack, by giving him a knife.</p>
                <p>[!note]
                At this point, the cameraman should get so in the way that everyone’s pissed. The film will end with no satisfactory ending.</p>

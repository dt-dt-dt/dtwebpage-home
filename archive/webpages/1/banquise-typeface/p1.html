        <h2>P1 - Film Stills</h2>
            <p>This project involved taking photographs to tell a story, as if they were shots from a movie. We needed an original premise for our story, along with composition/framing techniques, props, actors and post-processing.</p>

            <h2>premise</h2>
                <p>An anxiety-ridden office worker must unravel the events leading up to a tragedy he didn't cause... yet.</p>
                <p>An everyday office worker living with anxiety lives his life daydreaming... about disaster and catastrophe. Overthinking about his everyday situations, he tends to imagine that things will go horribly wrong. When he is suddenly given a newspaper that foretells a tragedy he supposedly will cause, he is thrust into a quest to unravel just what's happening-- could his overthinking finally come to fruition?</p>
            <h2>themes</h2>
            <h3>philosophical side</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Existentialism, absurdism (?)</li>
                <ul><li>No inherent point, no point worrying</li></ul>
                <li>Solipsist character</li>
                <ul><li>Free will</li></ul>
            </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="element">
            <h3>mental side</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Anxiety, attachment</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Catastrophizing</em></li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <p>These two combine. Mental: "I fucked up, everything will go wrong, what do I do... etc." Philo: deterministic/fatalistic view.</p>
                <p>The anxiety breeds determinism: Will daydreams about catastrophe and disaster, and imagines everything will go wrong.</p>
                <p>This line of thinking costs him, and his fate is formed by it.</p>

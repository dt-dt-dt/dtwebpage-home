            <p>One day, you’ll start to break down and cook in your own juices.</p>
            <p>Now I’ve seen too much. Incessant tongues will write you up. Take it off. Yeah, get it off. Come on and on and get me off.</p>
            <p>Time has made you beautiful.</p>
            <p>But I’m scared. Yeah I’m scared half to death, won’t you think of me too? You can push, you can squeeze all you want, you can take it out again.</p>
            <p>Well that's just peachy. That's just peachy.</p>
            <p>Quietly weeping at the place it all happened.</p>
            <p>Drown yourself. Wallowing sorrow. Her shadow. Walking in circles. 5 o’clock now. When I see Him again, my mirror tells me to no end. I look over where hills are flat, and ask myself, “Why couldn’t that be-“ Taking note of bad advice, and pretty girls who won’t look twice. I look over where there’s cracks, and force myself to grow a pair.
            </p>
            <p>Cheap and trendy</p>
            <p>The idea of forgetting en masse. We all gather in our spot. We all remember what happened. We choose to forget together. Up, men, up</p>
            <p>The twitch in my eye won't go away</p>
            <p>You can scream, and you can shout. But no— it’s never enough. I said, I said. Yeah, I’m a supermodern city boy who’s itching and-uh scratching. I’ll say, I’ll say. All the yuppies buy XEQT, but I’m the one who’s rotting in hell. (All the yuppies and executives, but I’m the one who’s rotting in hell). In hell, in hell</p>
            <p>Might as well steal my clothes and leave me homeless and hungry.</p>
            <p>No one to calm me down.</p>
            <p>I thought this time would be different.</p>
            <p>Drinking my own piss, just to shed tears for you again.</p>
            <p>I'm pretty miserable, actually. Actually, I'm pretty miserable.</p>
            <p>Giving up is easier than it looks. Giving up is harder than it looks.</p>
            <p>Triple crossed and wronged again, I’ll make a man of you. Rising costs over again, a lack of oxygen. (You are my oxygen.) One day you'll start (we make it look so easy) to break down and cook. (we make it look so easy). He burns on and on and on— my pockets are for you. Every body has a story. I wonder what yours is too. Lift up your skirt. (we make it look so easy) Let me in the house. (we make it look so easy)</p>
